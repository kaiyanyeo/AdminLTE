# About
This repository contains the code for the static screens of a customer portal for an imaginary healthcare focused portal. This repository and its contents are adapted from [AdminLTE]("https://almsaeedstudio.com/themes/AdminLTE/index.html"), of which the documentation and source code are available [here]("https://github.com/almasaeed2010/AdminLTE").

## Pages
All pages are from the perspective of a patient using the portal or from the perspective of a family member using the portal to facilitate procedures for the patient.

#### Past Appointments
The patient can better understand the procedures that he has gone through or has upcoming. Other details also include the nurses responsible for the procedure, some consumables and whether the respective payments has been made.

#### Payments/Receipts
This page allows the patient to be able to view at first glance which payment has been made. Payment details are also available.
